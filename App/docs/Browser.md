## Browser Pane

This provides a limited use case single HTML browser pane. 

This can be useful for many things; such as displaying this help file; interacting with the programming scheme online book; or displaying some reports.  

All sorts of things are possible; such as creating and calling code in the browser and having scripts call back to Scheme; however I do not recommend this.

If you are looking to make extensive use of a browser; for example to create an App that uses a browser as its user interface with scheme behind the scenes; please do not use this app; there are better available options out there.
