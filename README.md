# Scheme-Windows-Workspace
A windows workspace for scheme (native win32 C++ version.)

## Reason

I prefer a workspace type interface rather than a terminal interface.

I dislike text rushing off the screen.

I like panes rather than overlapping windows; there is an invisible splitter between them; you can drag that.

## Win32 version

This is the more old-fashioned conventional win32 version of a workspace for running scheme.

It uses the legacy web view for documentation only (well recommended only for that) and Scintilla for text.

## Requires Windows 10 64bit.
