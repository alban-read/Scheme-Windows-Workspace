# Scheme-Windows-Workspace
This is a windows workspace for Chez Scheme.
[Latest version is over here](https://github.com/alban-read/Scheme-Windows-Tiled-Shell)


## Reason

Provides a simple alternative to a terminal; creates a workspace type interface; that prevents text rushing off the screen;  keeps results and output into a different pane than the script source.

Uses tiled panes rather than overlapping windows; there are several standard view combinations that rearrange the panes.

Provides a graphical output pane.

I use versions of this application to write apps that script dozens of C libraries; Chez Scheme is very good at that.

## Fun things

You can work through the online Scheme programming book; executing the examples as you go.

## Win32 version

This is the conventional win32 version of a workspace for running scheme.

It uses the legacy (IE11) web view for documentation and Scintilla for text.

There are other variants of this idea; that are modern browser/web view integrated. 



## Requires Windows 10 64bit.
